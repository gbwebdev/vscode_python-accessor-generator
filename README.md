# python-accessor-generator README

This extension aims at facilitating object-oriented programming in Python by automatically generating "property-type" accessors from a class's attributes definition. 

## Features

### Accessors generation from attributes definition

![feature X](https://github.com/gbwebdev/vscode_python-accessor-generator/blob/main/images/accessors-generation-from-attributes-def.gif?raw=true)

You need to have attributes definition like these :

```python
  self._id: int = None
  self._name: str = None
```

(you need to set the type !)

Just select the definitions and run the "Generate Accessors" function.

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.
